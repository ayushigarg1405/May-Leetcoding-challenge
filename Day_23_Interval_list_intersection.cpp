Question:

Given two lists of closed intervals, each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.

Return the intersection of these two interval lists.

(Formally, a closed interval [a, b] (with a <= b) denotes the set of real numbers x with a <= x <= b.  
The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that is either empty, or can be represented as a closed interval.  
For example, the intersection of [1, 3] and [2, 4] is [2, 3].)

Solution Approach:

Checking the last and first element of each pair.

Solution:

class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> intervalIntersection(vector<vector<int>>& A, vector<vector<int>>& B) {
        vector<vector<int>> v;
        int i=0,j=0;
        while(i<A.size() && j<B.size()){
            int l=max(A[i][0], B[j][0]);
            int u=min(A[i][1], B[j][1]);
            if(l<=u) v.push_back({l,u});
            if(A[i][1] < B[j][1])   i++;
            else j++;
        }
        return v;
    }
};

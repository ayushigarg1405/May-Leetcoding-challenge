Question:

Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove k digits from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible.

Note:
The length of num is less than 10002 and will be â‰¥ k.
The given num does not contain any leading zero.
Example 1:

Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
Output: "1219"
Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.
Example 2:

Input: num = "10200", k = 1
Output: "200"
Explanation: Remove the leading 1 and the number is 200. Note that the output must not contain leading zeroes.
Example 3:

Input: num = "10", k = 2
Output: "0"
Explanation: Remove all the digits from the number and it is left with nothing which is 0.

Solution Approach:
If next character of string is greater than the previous, remove the character.
If prev char is greater than current, then remove the character.

Solution:

class Solution {
public:
    string removeKdigits(string num, int k) {
        string res = "";
        for(char &c : num){
            while(res.size()!=0 && res.back() > c && k){
                res.pop_back();
                k--;
            }
            if(res.size()!=0 || c != '0')
                res.push_back(c);
        }
        while(res.size()!=0 && k--){
            res.pop_back();
        }
        if(res.length() == 0)
            res.push_back('0');
        return res;
    }
};
